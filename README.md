# 6.819-Final-Project
Final Project for MIT 6.819

There are two steps to the project.

1) Preprocessing into a graph structure

- graphmaker.py takes an input image and outputs a graph structure where we can partition image -> lines -> words -> letters.

2) CNN for letter recognition
To do:
- train with EMNIST ByClass data |  lowercase, uppercase, digits
- train with EMNIST ByMerge data | digits, letters
data is 28 x 28 in .mat format
